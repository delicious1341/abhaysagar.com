				<div>
					<h3>Academic Poster Conference</h3>
					<p>Online Conference at the Cavendish Laboratory, <time datetime="2021-03">Lent Term 2021</time></p>
					
					<p>Formed a group with three other physicists with the goal to introduce the wave nature of light phenomena to first year and prospective undergraduate physics students at the university.</p>
					<p>We produced an academic poster for the Lent Term 2021 conference and gave presentations, which met the scrutiny of senior academic staff.</p>
					<p>In the process we worked remotely as a group, utilising the Google Workspaces for real-time collaboration, during pandemic restrictions.</p>
					<p>Team work involved: delegating responsibilities, documenting progress, constructively improving each other's contributions, discussing the scientific literature and test screening our explanations with target audiences.</p>

					<h3>STEP Preparation Course</h3>
					<p>University of Leicester Advanced Mathematics Support Programme & STEP Preparation Course, <time datetime="2018-09">09/2018</time>-<time datetime="2019-06">06/2019</time></p>
					
					<p>Worked in groups with other students to tackle in-depth problems together while receiving and criticism from graduates, discussed the effectiveness of techniques and diagnosed problem structures and used math concepts far beyond A-level to solve new problems.</p>
					<p>Working alongside peers in a completely different style to typical schoolwork, talking through the problems, and explaining to each other our different approaches at roadblocks; greatly developed my team-working abilities and communication skills. I became more versatile at approaching tasks and use feedback more effectively.</p>
				</div>

			<section>
				<div>
					<h3>Budding Brunnels</h3>
					<p>Construction industry programme with Willmott Dixon at De Montfort University, <time>2018</time></p>
					
					<p>Met and interviewed people involved with every step of construction, from the project managers, architects and sustainability officers and construction site managers. I developed better communication skills and an understanding of the logistics and admin that goes into planning and construction as well as the importance of different roles.</p>
					<p>Visited the construction site for Fullhurst Community College and got to see first-hand the organisation into which different teams of contractors had to work.</p>
					<p>Participated in a team project where we designed a college to a specification and pitch the construction plan to local council developers and construction site managers. I improved at CAD and model making as well as team working and presenting/debating.</p>

					<h3>Senior Space School UK</h3>
					<p>Space industry programme with Lockheed Martin scholarship in partnership with the University of Leicester, <time datetime="2018-08">08/2018</time></p>
					
					<p>Engaged in engineering team projects:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>constructing a rocket and moving rover payload which we succeeded in launching and landing in an annual competition.</li>
						<li>built and tested ablative heat shields using metal sheets at the National Space Centre ran by the National Space Agency.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Attended lecture courses including an Airbus Engineering Space Dynamics course on: orbital and altitude control systems of satellites; angular momentum, Kepler's laws and ellipses in Hohmann Transfer.</p>
					<p>Participated in a Lockheed Martin Conference to showcase upcoming projects from 2019.</p>
					<p>Operated the University of Leicester Observatory in the Oadby village campus, calibrating the telescope and its software.</p>
					<p>Mentored by PhD students to follow their research paper on Comparing Star Formations in Low Redshift Galaxies in Hubble’s Sequence H-Alpha. From which I built an appreciation of the challenge of research with the experience of service and technical proposals to book the use of European observatories and acquiring high precision filters to search for specific radiation.</p>
